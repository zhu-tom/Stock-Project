Extensions:
- Used React Typescript for frontend
- Support for multiple screen sizes and interfaces (desktop and mobile-friendly)
- Fully integrated MongoDB into application

Design Decisions:
- Separated frontend components into separate or nested folders, grouping them based on functionality and relationships
- Use of Ant Design as a frontend component library significantly improves user experience and makes it easier to develop large scale enterprise applications 
- Develop frontend routing using React Router to allow for more modular design as parts can be separated better when the Switch Router is used
